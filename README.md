# Telco Customer Churn Detection – End-to-End MLOps

This repository contains a **production-grade, end-to-end MLOps pipeline**
for **Telco Customer Churn Prediction**, developed as part of the **ML Zoomcamp**.

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a telco customer is likely to churn using historical customer data,
and operationalize the model using MLOps best practices.
